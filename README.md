# Data Science

I shall use this repository to exlain each of the data science related algorithms using an example data set. These examples can be used as a reference for next time when we want to use a similar approach on different data set. I shall also add relevant material for the particular algorithm along with them.

Most of the analysis is done using R and the data sets will be open source data sets or Kaggle data sets. Few of the Algorithms that would be covered are but not limited to

+ Dimension Reduction
+ Clustering
+ Classification
+ Data Mining
+ Machine Learning
